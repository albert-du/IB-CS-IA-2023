# Client Product Evaluation Meeting
*After installing the pwa application on client's devices and demoing functionality*

> Any questions with the application?
Client: What's this blue box for?

> That's the current page, there aren't enough items for a second page so it's alone
Client: Oh ok

> I can change the UI so it won't show if there's only one page
Client: That would be better

> Any other questions?
Client: Could there be more colors? There aren't many options.

> Sure I can improve this. I'll add more colors and a better color picker

> Any other questions?
Client: What categories should I create?
> Any categories you want, you can add as many as you want, or delete them.

> Any other questions?
Client: No, this is great. Thank you
